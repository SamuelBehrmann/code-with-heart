This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Database

This project uses supabase as the database provider. Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative that provides a set of tools to build and scale applications.
You can add the connection to the database by creating a .env file.

This file needs two variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

### Client and Server 

In Next.js you can create client and server components. Both can access data from the database. There are two different helper modules to read data. 
Client: `@utils/client.js`
Server: `@utils/server.js`

## Shadcn UI
[Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) |
[Components](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components) |


A library of pre-defined and styled components. By default the pre-defined component should be used. Only if the component does not fit the
use-case, it should be extended / edited / adjusted. This ensures a coherent design throughout the application.

To use a component it has to be added to the project first.
